## About

This repository was created in a **collaborative** way to centralize and document the EAFC (EA Sports FC) API endpoints. Despite years of requests from the community, EA Sports still **has not released a public API**, so this project aims to fill that gap.  

The main focus of the project is to **document and organize endpoints across all game modes**, allowing developers and enthusiasts to study the game's communication, create analysis tools, or simply learn about API calls in online games.

## Author's main goal

While the repository's main objective is to document endpoints in general, the **author's main goal** is to discover a way to obtain **statistics from online friendly matches**, which are currently not officially available from EA Sports.
